# Calculator-App

A sleek and responsive web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides basic arithmetic operations, error handling, and a user-friendly interface with a modern design.

# 📖 Overview
This calculator allows users to perform quick calculations using a simple grid-based button layout. It incorporates basic mathematical operators, clear and delete functionality, and keyboard input support. The application ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining security and responsiveness.

# Features include:
✔ Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷)
✔ Backspace (DE button): Deletes the last entered character
✔ Full Reset (AC button): Clears the display completely
✔ Keyboard Support: Allows input from both buttons and keyboard keys
✔ Error Handling: Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero)
✔ Smooth UI with animations: Responsive layout for better usability
✔ Mobile & Desktop Compatibility: Adjusts to different screen sizes with CSS media queries

# 🛠 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository (if using Git)
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/calculator-app.git
2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder and locate index.html.
3️⃣ Open index.html in any browser—no additional installation needed!
4️⃣ Runs fully on client-side technology, no database or dependencies required.

# Usage Instructions
1️⃣ Enter numbers using the keypad or buttons.
2️⃣ Select operators (+, -, ×, ÷) for calculations.
3️⃣ Press = to compute the result.
4️⃣ Use DE to delete characters one by one.
5️⃣ Use AC to reset the entire display.
# ✔ Example Usage
Input:  24 + 6
Output: 30
Input:  50 ÷ 0
Output: Infinity (Handled safely)

# 📂 File Structure

 ├── 📄 index.html    # Main structure (UI elements)

 ├── 📄 README.md     # Project documentation (this file)
🔹 index.html – Contains button elements and input fields for calculations
🔹 styles.css – Handles UI styling, animations, and media queries for mobile-friendly design
🔹 script.js – Implements calculation logic, button event listeners, and validation

# ⚠ Limitations
🔸 No advanced functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms)
🔸 No history tracking—Users can't see past calculations
🔸 Limited input validation—Does not support complex expressions
🔸 No memory storage—Currently lacks "M+" or "MR" functionality
🔸 No dark/light mode toggle—Only one static theme

# 🚀 Future Improvements
🔹 Implement a history log to show past calculations
🔹 Add scientific calculator features (square root, sin/cos/tan, exponents)
🔹 Introduce memory storage (M+, M-, MR, MC)
🔹 Improve keyboard support—Allow pressing "Enter" for calculation
🔹 Build a dark/light mode switch for better UI customization
🔹 Enhance accessibility features for better usability
